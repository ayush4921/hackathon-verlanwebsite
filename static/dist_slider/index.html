			<h1 class="animate slideInLeft ">The problem</h1>
			<p class="animate slideInLeft delay-3">Can you really count on social media posts about your lost pet? What information can you recall from the last missing poster you saw? 

				Our pets are way too precious for us to depend on crowd-sourced searches. Your pet’s life shouldn’t depend on whether or not a stranger glanced at a picture of your dog, and we believe there is a 21st century alternative.

				<h1 class="animate slideInLeft">Easy interface:</h1>
				<p class="animate slideInLeft delay-2"> There is no looking at yucky terminal outputs or a cluttered UI. We implemented a clean, friendly design to suit everyone’s needs.
				</p>
				<h1 class="animate slideInLeft">Let the tech do the searching: </h1>
				<p class="animate slideInLeft delay-2">Our drones have been equipped with an advanced neural network to analyze footage and recognize your dog breed. You’ll receive word when your dog has been found, and you can rest peacefully at the comfort of your home knowing that drones are hard at work.</p>

			<h1 class="animate slideInLeft ">What we learned:</h1>
			<p class="animate slideInLeft delay-3">Throughout this project our team learned how to integrate python in the backend with frontend scripts. We also learned how to make more effective machine learning models using cloud servers and how to scrape google images for larger datasets.

				<h1 class="animate slideInLeft">Problems:</h1>
				<p class="animate slideInLeft delay-2">Like all great code, ours had a few hiccups in development. After confirming that our proof of concept would work and training our model in a Google cloud server, we found that our accuracy was only 70%. Clearly, we needed to optimize our code, so we added more layers, switched to the Adam optimizer, used slower learning rates, and trained on a gpu. With these edits, our model was able to reach a 98% test accuracy in literal minutes. However, our validation accuracy was still quite low, but a complete revamp and training for 8+ hrs resulted in over a 90% validation accuracy which is quite remarkable.

			<h1 class="animate slideInLeft ">Accomplishments:</h1>
			<p class="animate slideInLeft delay-3">We were able to make a very effective model that can predict 120 different dog breeds with over 99% test accuracy and over 90% validation accuracy -- both world class percentages that have never been achieved before in a project like this. We even did this with complete faith that our model would reach this efficiency, and this allowed for us to streamline workflow based on our confidence in our code.

		<section class="com__section com__section--text">
			<h1 class="animate slideInLeft ">What’s next:</h1>
			<p class="animate slideInLeft delay-3">The most important next step for us will be to access larger datasets to train the model to be able to recognize cats and maybe even other mammals to aid in detecting wildlife presence after natural disasters like wildfires. Having publicly available drones operating will also be useful and attract more people to the site.
